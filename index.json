In this study, we present a deep learning method, named DeepGS, to predict phenotypes from genotypes. Using a deep convolutional neural network, DeepGS uses hidden variables that jointly represent features in genotypes when making predictions; it also employs convolution, sampling and dropout strategies to reduce the complexity of high-dimensional genotypic data. We used a large GS dataset to train DeepGS and compared its performance with other methods. The experimental results indicate that DeepGS can be used as a complement to the commonly used RR-BLUP in the prediction of phenotypes from genotypes. The complementarity between DeepGS and RR-BLUP can be utilized using an ensemble learning approach for more accurately selecting individuals with high phenotypic values, even for the absence of outlier individuals and subsets of genotypic markers.

Understanding of the epitranscriptome is hampered by the absence of computational tools for the systematic analysis of epitranscriptome sequencing data. In addition, no tools have yet been designed for accurate prediction of CMRs in plants, or to extend epitranscriptome analysis from a fraction of the transcriptome to its entirety.\n**Results:**\nHere, we introduce PEA, an integrated R toolkit to facilitate the analysis of plant epitranscriptome data. The PEA toolkit contains a comprehensive collection of functions required for read mapping, CMR calling, motif scanning and discovery and gene functional enrichment analysis. PEA also takes advantage of machine learning (ML) technologies for transcriptome-scale CMR prediction, with high prediction accuracy, using the Positive Samples Only Learning algorithm, which addresses the two-class classification problem by using only positive samples (CMRs), in the absence of negative samples (non-CMRs). Hence PEA is a versatile epitranscriptome analysis pipeline covering CMR calling, prediction and annotation and we describe its application to predict N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in Arabidopsis thaliana. Experimental results demonstrate that the toolkit achieved 71.6% sensitivity and 73.7% specificity, which is superior to existing m6A predictors. PEA is potentially broadly applicable to the in-depth study of epitranscriptomics.\n**Availability and implementation:**\nPEA Docker image is available at https://hub.docker.com/r/malab/pea, source codes and user manual are available at https://github.com/cma2015/PEA.","tags":[],"title":"PEA: an Integrated R Toolkit for Plant Epitranscriptome Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Xiaoxue Dang**","Zheng Liu","Yanzhuo Zhou","Peizi Chen","Jiyuan Liu","Xiaojun Yao","**Beilei Lei***"],"categories":null,"content":" 甾体特异性靶标库的构建及筛选研究   甾体类分子是生物界出现最广泛的成分之一，在各种生物过程中发挥着关键作用。确定甾体类分子的潜在靶点对研究其生理生化活性、毒副作用及生理作用具有重要意义。传统的靶标发现依赖实验，但前期的虚拟筛选能够排除大量的不可能的靶标，降低实验盲目性。现有的综合性的靶标虚拟筛选平台如idTarget和TarFishDock 包含大量晶体，给出的筛选结果为PDB晶体的列表，存在着假阳性的和蛋白结构冗余的问题。为此本课题设计了更精确的甾体类分子靶标预测方法，利用配体的化学结构相似性和KEGG的生化反应中酶和底物相互作用的原理分别从Drugbank和KEGG搜集构建了一个包含3325 晶体结构，196类蛋白的甾体特异性靶标库。该库的所有蛋白都经过人工检查以消除错误。并在前期搜集过程中考虑了甾体分子的特异性，降低了基于结构的靶标筛选的假阳性。最后的筛选结果用蛋白种类代替PDB ID进行排序，能有效提高筛选的效率和准确性。此外通过每一类蛋白的结构冗余，将不同的活性构象分数整合，能考虑到蛋白质的柔韧性，使预测更加准确。通过对甘氨胆酸和24-epibrassinolide的实例研究，发现其能有效预测出甘氨胆酸所有已知晶体结构的靶标，且与idTarget相比预测精度更高，证明了其强大的预测准确性。构建的甾体特异性蛋白库可用于对所有甾体类分子进行靶标筛选和预测，为后续的实验验证提供指导。甾体特异性靶标库的构建及后续验证比较与筛选研究流程如图3所示，相关成果已在Steroids（Dang et al.,2018）发表。\n 图.特异性靶标库的构建及后续验证比较与筛选研究\n","date":1538928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538928000,"objectID":"7af7959e1c1b5245451e7ab6971b1be0","permalink":"/publication/steroids_2018_steroidstarget/","publishdate":"2018-10-08T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/steroids_2018_steroidstarget/","section":"publication","summary":"Steroids exist universally and play critical roles in various biological processes. Identifying potential targets of steroids is of great significance in studying their physiological and biochemical activities, the side effects and for drug repurposing. Herein, aiming at more precise steroids targets prediction, a steroids-specific target library integrating 3325 PDB or homology modeling structures categorized into 196 proteins was built by considering chemical similarity from DrugBank and biological processes from KEGG. The main properties of this library include: (1) It was manually prepared and checked to eliminate mistakes. (2) The library enriched the possible steroids targets and could decrease the false positives of structure-based target screening for steroids. (3) The ranking by protein name instead of PDB ID could make the screening more efficiency and precise. (4) Protein flexibility was taken into account partially by the different active conformations through the structural redundancy of each category of protein, which leads to more accurate prediction. The case studies of glycocholic acid and 24-epibrassinolide proved its powerful predictive accuracy.

Here, we mapped in vivo binding sites of O2 in B73 endosperm, and compared the results with genes differentially expressed in B73 and B73o2. We identified 186 putative direct O2 targets and 1,677 indirect targets, encoding a broad set of gene functionalities. Examination of the temporal expression patterns of O2 targets revealed at least two distinct modes of O2-mediated gene activation. Two O2-activated genes, bZIP17 and NAKED ENDOSPERM2 (NKD2), encode transcription factors, which can in turn co-activate other O2-network genes with O2. NKD2 (with its paralog NKD1) was previously shown to be involved in regulation of aleurone development.

In this study, we introduced PEA-m5C, a machine learning-based m5C predictor trained with features extracted from the flanking sequence of m5C modifications. PEA-m5C yielded an average AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic) of 0.939 in 10-fold cross-validation experiments based on known Arabidopsis m5C modifications.

In most situations, DNA methylation patterns are inherited quite stably. However, changes in DNA methylation can occur at some loci as a result of tissue culture resulting in somaclonal variation. To investigate heritable epigenetic changes as a consequence of tissue culture, a sequence-capture bisulfite sequencing approach was implemented to monitor context-specific DNA methylation patterns in ∼15Mb of the maize genome for a population of plants that had been regenerated from tissue culture. Plants that have been regenerated from tissue culture exhibit gains and losses of DNA methylation at a subset of genomic regions. There was evidence for a high rate of homozygous changes to DNA methylation levels that occur consistently in multiple independent tissue culture lines suggesting that some loci are either targeted or hotspots for epigenetic variation. The consistent changes inherited following tissue culture include both gains and losses of DNA methylation and can affect CG, CHG or both contexts within a region. Only a subset of the tissue culture changes observed in callus plants are observed in the primary regnerants but the majority of DNA methylation changes present in primary regenerants are passed onto offspring. This study provides insights into the susceptibility of some loci and potential mechanisms that could contribute to altered DNA methylation and epigenetic state that occur during tissue culture in plant species.","tags":[],"title":"Heritable Epigenomic Changes to the Maize Methylome Resulting from Tissue Culture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Junfeng Tan**","**Zhenyan Miao**","**Chengzhi Ren**","**Ruxia Yuan**","**Yunjia Tang**","**Xiaorong Zhang**","**Zhaoxue Han**","**Chuang Ma***"],"categories":null,"content":" 揭示了糖基转移酶家族47的起源进化和表达模式   糖基转移酶家族47(GT47)的基因编码合成果胶，木葡聚糖和木聚糖的β-半乳糖基转移酶和β-葡糖醛酸基转移酶，在细胞壁的生物合成中发挥着重要的作用。我们的研究发现，GT47家族可能起源于蓝藻，并且在进化到苔藓植物的过程中发生扩展，其中2个起源于苔藓植物的Clades主要由intron-poor的基因组成。基因复制分析显示GT47家族在玉米中的扩展是由串联复制事件和大片段复制事件驱动的，且这些复制基因几乎全部都是intron-poor的基因。表达分析表明，几个intron-poor的GT47基因可能参与玉米干旱胁迫反应和种子发育。（Tan et al，planta，2017）\n 图.GT47家族的进化规律和表达模式\n","date":1519833600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519833600,"objectID":"9f1c332da86b977576c0ee8385790f47","permalink":"/publication/planta_2018_gt47/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/planta_2018_gt47/","section":"publication","summary":"A large-scale bioinformatics analysis revealed the origin and evolution of GT47 gene family, and identified two clades of intron-poor genes with putative functions in drought stress responses and seed development in maize.\nGlycosyltransferase family 47 (GT47) genes encode β-galactosyltransferases and β-glucuronyltransferases that synthesize pectin, xyloglucans and xylan, which are important components of the plant cell wall. In this study, we performed a systematic and large-scale bioinformatics analysis of GT47 gene family using 352 GT47 proteins from 15 species ranging from cyanobacteria to seed plants. The analysis results showed that GT47 family may originate in cyanobacteria and expand along the evolutionary trajectory to moss. Further analysis of 47 GT47 genes in maize revealed that they can divide into five clades with diverse exon-intron structures. Among these five clades, two were mainly composed with intron-poor genes, which may originate in the moss. Gene duplication analysis revealed that the expansion of GT47 gene family in maize was significantly driven from tandem duplication events and segmental duplication events. Significantly, almost all duplicated genes are intron-poor genes. Expression analysis indicated that several intron-poor GT47 genes may be involved in the drought stress response and seed development in maize. This work provides insight into the origin and evolutionary process, expansion mechanisms and expression patterns of GT47 genes, thus facilitating their functional investigations in the future.","tags":[],"title":"Evolution of Intron-poor Clades and Expression Patterns of the Glycosyltransferase Family 47","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoming Wang#","Xue Shi#","**Siyuan Chen**","**Chuang Ma**","Shengbao Xu*"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1518019200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1518019200,"objectID":"4032a46876ee6e9d2466ff5b8a24b190","permalink":"/publication/front_plant-sci_2018_hsf/","publishdate":"2018-02-08T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/front_plant-sci_2018_hsf/","section":"publication","summary":"Plants, as sessile organisms, evolved a complex and functionally diverse *heat shock factor* (HSF) gene family to cope with various environmental stresses. However, the limited evolution studies of the *HSF* gene family have hindered our understanding of environmental adaptations in plants. In this study, a comprehensive evolution analysis on the *HSF* gene family was performed in 51 representative plant species. Our results demonstrated that the *HSFB* group which lacks a typical AHA activation domain, was the most ancient, and is under stronger purifying selection pressure in the subsequent evolutionary processes. While, dramatic gene expansion and functional divergence occurred at evolution timescales corresponding to plant land inhabit, which contribute to the emergence and diversification of the *HSFA* and *HSFC* groups in land plants. During the plant evolution, the ancestral functions of *HSFs* were maintained by strong purifying pressure that acted on the DNA binding domain, while the variable oligomerization domain and motif organization of *HSFs* underwent functional divergence and generated novel subfamilies. At the same time, variations were further accumulated with plant evolution, and this resulted in remarkable functional diversification among higher plant lineages, including distinct *HSF* numbers and selection pressures of several *HSF* subfamilies between monocots and eudicots, highlighting the fundamental differences in different plant lineages in response to environmental stresses. Taken together, our study provides novel insights into the evolutionary origin, pattern and selection pressure of plant *HSF*s and delineates critical clues that aid our understanding of the adaptation processes of plants to terrestrial environments.","tags":[],"title":"Evolutionary Origin, Gradual Accumulation and Functional Divergence of Heat Shock Factor Gene Family with Plant Evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Zhenyan Miao#**","**Zhaoxue Han#**","**Ting Zhang**","**Siyuan Chen**","**Chuang Ma***"],"categories":null,"content":" 系统解析了玉米不同组织在生长发育和胁迫信号刺激下的关键基因的响应机制   植物一生中受到各种发育和胁迫相关的刺激信号，而它们通过错综复杂的信号通路和转录重编程来保证发育进程和抵抗胁迫的伤害。为了研究这一生物过程，寻找关键基因，我们利用共表达网络的方法对玉米干旱胁迫下的时空表达谱展开分析。我们在共表达网络模块中发现了800多个关键基因，进一步发现它们在进化中更加保守。同时，在玉米驯化改良过程中存在着对这些胁迫发育相关基因的正向选择。共表达网络和调控网络结合发现起关键作用的bHLH，NAC，C2H2等转录因子家族成员在玉米应答干旱胁迫和发育中扮演着双重重要角色。这项研究通过对玉米干旱胁迫下不同组织和发育时期基因表达的响应机制系统挖掘揭示了一系列进化，调控相关的枢纽基因。（Miao et al, Scientific reports, 2017）。\n **图.玉米干旱胁迫下时空特异性响应机制的系统性研究**\n","date":1504195200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504195200,"objectID":"4ac78d1b5c6d9b009564d0c9d007f0b7","permalink":"/publication/scientific_reports_2017_droughtstress/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/scientific_reports_2017_droughtstress/","section":"publication","summary":"Crops are often subjected to periods of drought stress during their life cycle.

To evaluate the gene resources for heat adaptation in hexaploid wheat, small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), the key plant heat protection genes, were comprehensively analysed in wheat and related species. We found that the sHSPs of hexaploid wheat were massively expanded in A and B subgenomes with intrachromosomal duplications during polyploidization. These expanded sHSPs were under similar purifying selection and kept the expressional patterns with the original copies. Generally, a strong purifying selection acted on the α-crystallin domain (ACD) and theoretically constrain conserved function. Meanwhile, weaker purifying selection and strong positive selection acted on the N-terminal region, which conferred sHSP flexibility, allowing adjustments to a wider range of substrates in response to genomic and environmental changes. Notably, in CI, CV, ER, MI and MII subfamilies, gene duplications, expression variations and functional divergence occurred before wheat polyploidization. Our results indicate the massive expansion of active sHSPs in hexaploid wheat may also provide more raw materials for evolving functional novelties and generating genetic diversity to face future global climate changes, and highlight the expansion of stress response genes with wheat polyploidization.","tags":[],"title":"Massive Expansion and Differential Evolution of Small Heat Shock Proteins with Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)

Nevertheless, these network-based gene prioritization algorithms have encountered several problems; one in particular is that of unsatisfactory prediction accuracy due to limited network coverage, varying link quality, and/or uncertain network connectivity. Thus, a model that integrates complementary biological data may be expected to increase the prediction accuracy of gene prioritization. Toward this goal, we developed a novel gene prioritization method named RafSee, to rank candidate genes using a random forest algorithm that integrates sequence, evolutionary, and epigenetic features of plants. Subsequently, we proposed an integrative approach named RAP (Rank Aggregation-based data fusion for gene Prioritization), in which an order statistics-based meta-analysis was used to aggregate the rank of the network-based gene prioritization method and RafSee, for accurately prioritizing candidate genes involved in a pre-specific biological function. Finally, we showcased the utility of RAP by prioritizing 380 flowering-time genes in Arabidopsis. The “leave-one-out” cross-validation experiment showed that RafSee could work as a complement to a current state-of-art network-based gene prioritization system (AraNet v2). Moreover, RAP ranked 53.68% (204/380) flowering-time genes higher than AraNet v2, resulting in an 39.46% improvement in term of the first quartile rank. Further evaluations also showed that RAP was effective in prioritizing genes-related to different abiotic stresses. To enhance the usability of RAP for Arabidopsis and non-model plant species, an R package implementing the method is freely available at http://bioinfo.nwafu.edu.cn/software.","tags":[],"title":"A Meta-Analysis Based Method for Prioritizing Candidate Genes Involved in a Pre-specific Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Zhixu Qiu**","**Qian Cheng**","**Jie Song**","**Yunjia Tang**","**Chuang Ma***"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472659200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472659200,"objectID":"50ed297bb4cbf80ea4941d454e93b8c6","permalink":"/publication/icic_-2016_gs/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/icic_-2016_gs/","section":"publication","summary":"Genomic selection (GS) is a novel breeding strategy that selects individuals with high breeding value using computer programs.

Accordingly, we performed a high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of the maize endosperm transcriptome at 5, 10, 15 and 20 days after pollination (DAP). We found that more than 11,000 protein-coding genes underwent alternative splicing (AS) events during the four developmental stages studied. These genes were mainly involved in intracellular protein transport, signal transmission, cellular carbohydrate metabolism, cellular lipid metabolism, lipid biosynthesis, protein modification, histone modification, cellular amino acid metabolism, and DNA repair. Additionally, 7,633 genes, including 473 transcription factors (TFs), were differentially expressed among the four developmental stages. The differentially expressed TFs were from 50 families, including the bZIP, WRKY, GeBP and ARF families. Further analysis of the stage-specific TFs showed that binding, nucleus and ligand-dependent nuclear receptor activities might be important at 5 DAP, that immune responses, signalling, binding and lumen development are involved at 10 DAP, that protein metabolic processes and the cytoplasm might be important at 15 DAP, and that the responses to various stimuli are different at 20 DAP compared with the other developmental stages.

The evaluation results revealed their strengths and weakness for identifying stress-related promoters, providing valuable guidelines to accelerate the discovery of novel stress-related promoters and genes in plants.","tags":[],"title":"DNA Sequence and Structure Properties Analysis Reveals Similarities and Differences to Promoters of Stress Responsive Genes in Arabidopsis thaliana.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haibo Cui","**Jingjing Zhai**","**Chuang Ma***"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441036800,"objectID":"ab4458d0b7d17dd2930b32a3798780aa","permalink":"/publication/plos_one_2015_mirlocator/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/plos_one_2015_mirlocator/","section":"publication","summary":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short, non-coding RNA that play regulatory roles in a wide variety of biological processes, such as plant growth and abiotic stress responses. Although several computational tools have been developed to identify primary miRNAs and precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), very few provide the functionality of locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. This manuscript introduces a novel algorithm for predicting miRNAs named miRLocator, which isbased on machine learning techniques and sequence and structural features extracted from miRNA:miRNA* duplexes. To address the class imbalance problem (few real miRNAs and a large number of pseudo miRNAs), the prediction models in miRLocator were optimized by considering critical (and often ignored) factors that can markedly affect the prediction accuracy of mature miRNAs, including the machine learning algorithm and the ratio between training positive and negative samples. Ten-fold cross-validation on 5854 experimentally validated miRNAs from 19 plant species showed that miRLocator performed better than the state-of-art miRNA predictor miRdup in locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. miRLocator will aid researchers interested in discovering miRNAs from model and non-model plant species.","tags":[],"title":"miRLocator: Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Mature MicroRNAs within Plant Pre-miRNA Sequences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junpeng Zhan","Dhiraj Thakare","**Chuang Ma**","Alan Lloyd","Neesha M.

The endosperm of cereals is a main source of food, feed, and industrial raw materials worldwide. However, the genetic networks that regulate endosperm cell differentiation remain largely unclear. As a first step toward characterizing these networks, we profiled the mRNAs in five major cell types of the differentiating endosperm and in the embryo and four maternal compartments of the maize (*Zea mays*) kernel. Comparisons of these mRNA populations revealed the diverged gene expression programs between filial and maternal compartments and an unexpected close correlation between embryo and the aleurone layer of endosperm. Gene coexpression network analysis identified coexpression modules associated with single or multiple kernel compartments including modules for the endosperm cell types, some of which showed enrichment of previously identified temporally activated and/or imprinted genes. Detailed analyses of a coexpression module highly correlated with the basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL) identified a regulatory module activated by MRP-1, a regulator of BETL differentiation and function. These results provide a high-resolution atlas of gene activity in the compartments of the maize kernel and help to uncover the regulatory modules associated with the differentiation of the major endosperm cell types.","tags":[],"title":"RNA Sequencing of Laser-Capture Microdissected Compartments of the Maize Kernel Identifies Regulatory Modules Associated with Endosperm Cell Differentiation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Chuang Ma**","Hao Helen","Zhang HH","Xiangfeng Wang*"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1417363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417363200,"objectID":"e99e858bbd3037f537b3e12b26e987ed","permalink":"/publication/trends_in_plant_science_2014_machinelearning/","publishdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/trends_in_plant_science_2014_machinelearning/","section":"publication","summary":"Rapid advances in high-throughput genomic technology have enabled biology to enter the era of ‘Big Data’ (large datasets).

We present an ML-based methodology for transcriptome analysis via comparison of gene coexpression networks, implemented as an R package called machine learning-based differential network analysis (mlDNA) and apply this method to reanalyze a set of abiotic stress expression data in Arabidopsis thaliana. The mlDNA first used a ML-based filtering process to remove nonexpressed, constitutively expressed, or non-stressresponsive noninformative genes prior to network construction, through learning the patterns of 32 expression characteristics of known stress-related genes. The retained informative  genes were subsequently analyzed by ML-based network comparison to predict candidate stress-related genes showing expression and network differences between control and stress networks, based on 33 network topological characteristics. Comparative evaluation of the network-centric and gene-centric analytic methods showed that mlDNA substantially outperformed traditional statistical testing-based differential expression analysis at identifying stress-related genes, with markedly improved prediction accuracy. To experimentally validate the mlDNA predictions, we selected 89 candidates out of the 1784 predicted salt stress-related genes with available SALK T-DNA mutagenesis lines for phenotypic screening and identified two previously unreported genes, mutants of which showed salt-sensitive phenotypes.","tags":[],"title":"Machine Learning-based Differential Network Analysis: A Study of Stress-responsive Transcriptomes in Arabidopsis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mingming Xin","Ruolin Yang","Guosheng Li","Hao Chen","John Laurie","**Chuang Ma**","Dongfang Wang","Yingyin Yao","Brian A.

To identify the imprintome of early developing maize (*Zea mays*) endosperm, we performed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of whole kernels at 0, 3, and 5 d after pollination (DAP) and endosperms at 7, 10, and 15 DAP, using B73 by Mo17 reciprocal crosses. We observed gradually increased expression of paternal transcripts in 3- and 5-DAP kernels. In 7-DAP endosperm, the majority of the genes tested reached a 2:1 maternal versus paternal ratio, suggesting that paternal genes are nearly fully activated by 7 DAP. A total of 116, 234, and 63 genes exhibiting parent-specific expression were identified at 7, 10, and 15 DAP, respectively. The largest proportion of paternally expressed genes was at 7 DAP, mainly due to the significantly deviated parental allele expression ratio of these genes at this stage, while nearly 80% of the maternally expressed genes (MEGs) were specific to 10 DAP and were primarily attributed to sharply increased expression levels compared with the other stages. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of the imprinted genes suggested that 10-DAP endosperm-specific MEGs are involved in nutrient uptake and allocation and the auxin signaling pathway, coincident with the onset of starch and storage protein accumulation.","tags":[],"title":"Dynamic Expression of Imprinted Genes Associates with Maternally Controlled Nutrient Allocation during Maize Endosperm Development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Chuang Ma**","Xiangfeng Wang*"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1346428800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1346428800,"objectID":"510274e0bcc6f537827387f2b5d122f8","permalink":"/publication/plant_physiology_2012_rsgcc/","publishdate":"2012-09-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/plant_physiology_2012_rsgcc/","section":"publication","summary":"One of the computational challenges in plant systems biology is to accurately infer transcriptional regulation relationships based on correlation analyses of gene expression patterns. Despite several correlation methods that are applied in biology to analyze microarray data, concerns regarding the compatibility of these methods with the gene expression data profiled by high-throughput RNA transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology have been raised. These concerns are mainly due to the fact that the distribution of read counts in RNA-Seq experiments is different from that of fluorescence intensities in microarray experiments. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the existing correlation methods and, if necessary, introduction of novel methods into biology is appropriate. In this study, we compared four existing correlation methods used in microarray analysis and one novel method called the Gini correlation coefficient on previously published microarray-based and sequencing-based gene expression data in Arabidopsis (*Arabidopsis thaliana*) and maize (*Zea mays*). The comparisons were performed on more than 11,000 regulatory relationships in Arabidopsis, including 8,929 pairs of transcription factors and target genes. Our analyses pinpointed the strengths and weaknesses of each method and indicated that the Gini correlation can compensate for the shortcomings of the Pearson correlation, the Spearman correlation, the Kendall correlation, and the Tukey’s biweight correlation. The Gini correlation method, with the other four evaluated methods in this study, was implemented as an R package named **rsgcc** that can be utilized as an alternative option for biologists to perform clustering analyses of gene expression patterns or transcriptional network analyses.","tags":[],"title":"Application of the Gini Correlation Coefficient to Infer Regulatory Relationships in Transcriptome Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Chuang Ma**"," Hao Chen","Mingming Xin"," Ruolin Yang","Xiangfeng Wang*"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1346428800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1346428800,"objectID":"b84b015a406ba361626820217cc5ebce","permalink":"/publication/bioinformatics_2012_kgbassembler/","publishdate":"2012-09-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bioinformatics_2012_kgbassembler/","section":"publication","summary":"**MOTIVATION**:\nThe Brassicaceae family includes the most important plant model Arabidopsis thaliana and many cruciferous vegetable crops. A number of close relatives of Arabidopsis and economically important Brassica species are being sequenced with whole-genome shotgun sequencing technologies. However, de novo assembly of full chromosomes is difficult, since many non-model Brassicaceae species are lacking genetic and/or physical maps. As a unique feature for Brassicaceae, the genome of each member is composed of 24 conserved chromosomal blocks, and the arrangement of the 24 blocks can be obtained from karyotype analysis via comparative chromosome painting experiments. Taking this advantage, we developed a bioinformatic tool named KGBassembler to automatically finalize assembly of full chromosomes from contigs and/or scaffolds based on available karyotypes of Brassicaceae species.\n**AVAILABILITY**:\n**KGBassembler** was implemented in C++ with a graphical user interface.
