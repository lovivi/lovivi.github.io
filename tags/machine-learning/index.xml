      <description>Genomic selection (GS) is a promising breeding strategy by which the phenotypes of plant individuals are usually predicted based on genome-wide markers of genotypes. Conventional GS models typically make strong assumptions, resulting in difficulty capturing complex relationships within genotypes and between genotypes and phenotypes. To address this problem, we presented a deep learning (DL)-based model, named DeepGS, to automatically learn complex relationships without pre-defined rules. The experimental results indicate that DeepGS can be used as a complement to the commonly used RR-BLUP for more accurately selecting individuals with high phenotypic values.</description>

      <description>PEA is a docker-based integrated R toolkit that aims to facilitate the plant epitranscriptome analysis. This toolkit contains a comprehensive collection of functions required for read mapping, CMR calling, motif scanning and discovery, and gene functional enrichment analysis. PEA also takes advantage of machine learning technologies for transcriptome-scale CMR prediction, with high prediction accuracy, using the Positive Samples Only Learning algorithm, which addresses the two-class classification problem by using only positive samples (CMRs), in the absence of negative samples (non-CMRs).</description>

      <description>We developed PEA-m5C, an accurate transcriptome-wide m5C modification predictor under machine learning framework with random forest algorithm. PEA-m5C was trained with features from the flanking sequences of m5C modifications. In addition, we also deposited all the candidate m5C modification sites in the Ara-m5C database for follow-up functional mechanism researches. Finally, in order to maximize the usage of PEA-m5C, we implement it into a cross-platform, user-friendly and interactive interface and an R package named PEA-m5C based R statistical language and JAVA programming language, which may advance functional researches of m5C.</description>

      <description>Machine learning (ML) is an intelligent data mining technique to recognize patterns in large-scale data sets, the capability of which in Big Data analysis was exemplified in the Go match between Google’s artificial intelligence program AlphaGo and the world-class Go players like Lee Sedol. We presented an ML-based methodology termed mlDNA for large-scale integration analysis of transcriptome data via comparison of gene coexpression networks (Figure 3). mlDNA substantially outperformed traditional statistical testing–based differential expression analysis in identifying stress-related genes, with markedly improved prediction accuracy.</description>
